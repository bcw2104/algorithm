##quickSort

Quick sort is a method of sorting small or equal values based on the reference key by separating data with small values from those with large values into data with small values and those with large values.
    
1. Add values to the list.
2. Specify a value for the list.(We often call it a pivot.)
3. Based on the pivot, all elements smaller than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot and all elements larger than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot.
4. Resorts the left and right lists except for pivots.
5. Repeat until segmentation is no longer possible.

Time Complexity : worst case = O(N*N), average case = O(NlogN)
